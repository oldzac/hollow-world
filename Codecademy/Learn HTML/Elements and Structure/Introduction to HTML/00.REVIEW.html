Congratulations on completing the first lesson of HTML! You are well on your way to becoming a skilled web developer.

Let’s review what you’ve learned so far:

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the structure and content of a webpage.
Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags between them.
HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the child of the enclosing parent element.
Any visible content should be placed within the opening and closing <body> tags.
Headings and sub-headings, <h1> to <h6> tags, are used to provide titles for sections of content.
<p>, <span> and <div> tags specify text or blocks.
The <em> and <strong> tags are used to emphasize text.
Line breaks are created with the <br> tag.
Ordered lists (<ol>) are numbered and unordered lists (<ul>) are bulleted.
Images (<img>) and videos (<video>) can be added by linking to an existing source.
In the next lesson, we’ll take the content that you’ve added to this website and transform it into an HTML document that’s ready to go on the web.

Instructions
We’ve left you with your final code. Feel free to play around and modify it using the new elements you’ve learned!

If you want to review how to structure HTML in a project and use semantically meaningful elements, watch the video below and follow along with one of our experts:
