    Divs
One of the most popular elements in HTML is the <div> element. <div> is short for “division” or a container that divides the page into sections. These sections are very useful for grouping elements in your HTML together.

<body>
  <div>
    <h1>Why use divs?</h1>
    <p>Great for grouping elements!</p>
  </div>
</body>
<div>s don’t inherently have a visual representation, but they are very useful when we want to apply custom styles to our HTML elements. <div>s allow us to group HTML elements to apply the same styles for all HTML elements inside. We can also style the <div> element as a whole. You can see how this can be done in the Learn CSS course.

<div>s can contain any text or other HTML elements, such as links, images, or videos. Remember to always add two spaces of indentation when you nest elements inside of <div>s for better readability.

Instructions
1.
Below the <h1> heading that says The Brown Bear, add an opening <div> tag.

Place the closing </div> tag after the <h3> element that says Features.

Remember to use your space bar to add two spaces of indentation when you nest elements.
